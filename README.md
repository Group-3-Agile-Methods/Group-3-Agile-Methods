# Group-3-Agile-Methods
This is the Official repository for Group 3 (Agile Methods). The team aims to create a cutting-edge mobile application
called ArtiBridge in accordance with agile principles of software development.

## Project overview:
Artisans and artisan contractors are the skilled craftsmen who provide various hands-on services 
such as paintings, carpentry work, plumbing, electrical work etc.

In this area, both the artisans and the people who need their services face various challenges:
<br>o Artisans lack a platform where they can manage and display their services to the people 
(customers) who need them.
<br>o The customers or people in need of these artisan services do not have any medium where they 
can view and patronize the services. 
<br>o In the situation where they do manage to meet and the services have been completed, there is 
no platform to facilitate simple and hassle-free payment procedures. 

## Problem statement: 
A common problem for many skilled artisans currently, is to connect with their potential customers 
effectively. On the other hand, customers also find it difficult to locate and patronize reliable 
artisans for their needs. In view of this, there is an essential requirement for a simple and user 
friendly mobile application that makes the processes of displaying services, locating and booking 
services and facilitating payment options in the artisan and customer environment very effortless.

## Project objective:
The ArtiBridge mobile application is an application that seeks to: 
<br>o Connect artisans and potential customers through a user-friendly interface.
<br>o Facilitate a simple booking feature to allow customers to book the artisans they desire.
<br>o Provide a secure and simple payment system after service completion.
<br>o Employ a review system for artisans and customers to review each other based on certain 
criteria.

## Project scope:
<br>o User registration and authentication – The users are the artisans and their potential customers.
<br>o User profiles – For both artisans and customers.
<br>o Artisan page – Where artisans will display their services and users can book from there.
<br>o Reviews and rating system – Artisans and customers can review each other based on certain 
criteria.
<br>o Payment system – To facilitate payment after service completion. 
<br>o Admin panel – To manage users
<br>o Quality Assurance and testing – To ensure optimal performance of the application.

## Note:
Agile methods of software development are flexible and allow for adaptability to changing environments 
and requirements. In view of this, any of the information provided above is subject to change at any point in
